\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Name
  \item Where you're from
  \item Are you physically at UW?
  \item Year in school
  \item If you know what you want to do, your major/planned major (undecided is totally cool too!)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I'm a first year Ph.D. student at UW.
  \item I try to be really responsive via email, so don't hesitate to reach out.
  \item TA sessions will take place over Zoom
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Feel free to make suggestions about things that we can do differently! You likely have more experience with Zoom classes than I do, so your expertise and experience are valued.
      \item My personal preference is for you to keep your video on, if at all possible. I'd love to try to get to know you, and that connection will be easier if we can see each other!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Student Responsibilities}

\begin{frame}{Student Responsibilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Read the syllabus carefully!
        \item Do the readings for the lecture section \textit{before} the section.
        \item Write down answers to problems -- this is much better than doing them in your head.
        \item Your grade depends on the quality of your answers, not just getting the right answer.
        \item I \textit{highly} encourage you to form small groups to study and work with. Obviously this is tougher over Zoom, but it's highly beneficial.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Tuna Spaghetti?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item True/False/Uncertain: Mary purchases a tuna spaghetti at the school café for \$2 and just by smelling it she realizes that she doesn’t like it. The opportunity cost of throwing away the tuna spaghetti after purchasing it is \$2.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item False. Opportunity cost is about making a choice in the present. Obviously, since she does not have a choice over an action that has happened in the past, the \$2 she already spent is \textit{not} an opportunity cost.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tuna Spaghetti?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item True/False/Uncertain: Consider the previous scenario. Mary could sell the untouched tuna spaghetti to her friend for \$1. The opportunity cost of throwing away the tuna spaghetti is still \$2.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item False. Opportunity cost is about making a choice in the present. If she throws away the tuna spaghetti she forgoes the \$1 she would have received for it. The opportunity cost here is \$1 which is what she can get for it now, not \$2 which is what she \textit{already} spent.

\begin{frame}{Tuna Spaghetti?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the previous scenario. Mary purchases a tuna spaghetti at the school café for \$2 and just by smelling it she realizes that she doesn’t like it. Mary would like a hamburger instead of the tuna spaghetti, but decides that she will eat the tuna spaghetti she just purchased. A hamburger sells for \$2.50. She values a hamburger at \$4. The opportunity cost of eating the tuna spaghetti is then:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \$1.50
            \item \$2.50
            \item \$4.00
            \item \$6.50
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\beamerdefaultoverlayspecification{<+->}
\begin{frame}{Tuna Spaghetti?}
    Option 1 is correct. If Mary decides to eat the tuna spaghetti she is forgoing the benefits of a hamburger which is \$4 foregone (a benefit not gained is a cost). She is avoiding the cost of hamburger, which is \$2.5  (a cost that is avoided is a benefit). Therefore, the opportunity cost of eating the tuna spaghetti is net benefit forgone: \[\$4 - \$2.50 = \$1.50\]

%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item John has three choices for a vacation: seaside/beach, mountain cabin with hiking and, a fishing trip by the river (his least favorite choice). What is the opportunity cost in picking each of these vacations?
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item The opportunity cost of choosing to go to the mountain cabin to hike is the beach vacation given up. The opportunity cost of the beach vacation is the mountain cabin given up. What about the fishing trip?

% \begin{frame}{Example 2}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Jane decides to go to college instead of making money immediately by working full-time on a cruise ship after finishing high school.
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item The opportunity cost of attending college full time includes forgoing a salaried job after high school. Also included in the opp. cost is the tuition, and cost of books and supplies for college could have been spent on other goods and services.

%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Mona pays \$10 to go to a movie that lasts two hours and after 10 minutes she realizes that she really does not like the film. However, she continues to stay because she feels that she’s already spent ten dollars and wants to get her money’s worth. She continues to watch the film while thinking that she should have been spending time with her friends in the park and that is what she really wanted to do.
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item She thinks the opportunity cost of walking out of the theatre after 10 minutes is the \$10 lost. She is wrong! The opportunity cost is missing the walk with her friends in the park

% \begin{frame}{Question 4}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Jack is deciding between renting an apartment for one year and buying one. The monthly rent for the apartment is \$1,000 per month (\$12,000 per year). If he purchases the apartment, his mortgage would be the same (\$12,000) per year. Suppose that as a homeowner, he could subtract 10\% of his mortgage payment from his annual income tax payments. Considering no other costs to purchasing or renting the apartment and no change in the price of the apartment at the end of the year, what is Jack’s opportunity cost of renting the apartment for a year?
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item At the end of the year, Jack will pay \$12,000 to rent the apartment, and will pay \$12,000 to buy it.
